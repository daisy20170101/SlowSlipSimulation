# TriBIE
TriBIE is a parallelized Fortran90 (OpenMPI) code for simulating episodic slow slip events (SSEs) and earthquake cycles in an arbitrary curved fault buried in half-space medium. The quasi-dynamic formulation of shear traction and fault slip [Rice 1993] is implemented in spatial domain and the 5th-order Runge-Kutta method with adaptive time step integration is used in time domain. TriBIE has been used in many geophysical applications recently. TriBIE has also been verified in the SCEC Sequences of Earthquakes and Aseismic Slip Project (https://strike.scec.org/cvws/seas/). 

TriBIE is developed and currently maintaned by [Duo Li](https://daisy20170101.github.io/duo_li.github.io/), [Yajing Liu](https://www.mcgill.ca/eps/liu), [Hongyu Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XzF1Ed0AAAAJ&hl=en), [Lei Zhang](https://www.eq-igl.ac.cn/fgzc/info/2019/20831.html) and [Andrea Perez-Silva](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Andrea-Perez-Silva-2190753609).

## Static Green's function (or stiffness) calculation
### Stiffness in homogeneous half-space medium
We use analytical solution for stress tensor in polygon elements embeded in homogeneous half-space based on Comninou and Dundurs [1975] and Stuart [1997].
We fix the singularities using the method presented in Nikkhoo and Walter [2015, GJI]. The triangular mesh of fault interface can be created by [Trelis or Cubit](https://coreform.com/products/coreform-cubit/).

Please contact us if you need scripts for creating Trelis meshing file. 
    
### Using pylith for heterogeneous half-space medium
We can use [Pylith](https://geodynamics.org/resources/pylith) to calculate stiffness for triangular elements in 3D curved slab geometry with either 1D or 3D velocity.

Please contact us if you need help with calculating stiffness using PyLith.
